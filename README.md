# Vim-Two-Firewatch Colorscheme

## Why Two-Firewatch
[Simurai](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes) has created duotone themes for Atom.

DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (7 shades in total), toning down less important parts and hightlighting
only the important ones.

These themes come in different flavours (mostly dark) and some contributors have created light shades.

I wasn't satisfied with the adaptation to Vim, for different reasons:

* I loved the original duotone light theme
* I hated the original duotone dark theme, background was too... purple

I decided to give it a go:

* Be as close as possible to the duotone light theme
* Adapt firewatch for Atom so it fits with the duotone principle

## Appearance

Here is how this looks like:

Light version:
![Two-Firewatch Light Version][screenshot_light]

Dark version:
![Two-Firewatch Dark Version][screenshot_dark]

## Installation

Use your favorite vim plugin packager.

## Usage

If your environment supports italic, you can set `g:two_firewatch_italics=1` in your `vimrc`
